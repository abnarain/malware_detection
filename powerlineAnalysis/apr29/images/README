These are power traces when a pixstar photoframe is connected and a binary is
run through it.

The data is collected at CF= 200KHz, SR= 400 KHz using PLC coupler.

These plots answer following questions : 
1) Which frequency ranges to look into :-
the binary (main)  and correspodings spectrograms (bin_on_off_<freq1>_<freq2>... is run on processor and the frequency ranges upto 1 MHz is
scanned. Lower frequencies have much more information than the higher ones.

2) You can see the frequency where the device shows up in photoframe_on_off.png.
This is different from the frequency range raspberry pi shows up (~200 kHz) in
the last email.

3)lowpass, without_lowpass are spectrograms when the lowpass filter of GNU Radio
is applied. Seems there is not much difference between the two. Good to know
