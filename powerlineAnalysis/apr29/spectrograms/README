PART A
The spectrograms are of following activities:

1) program main.c - c_code/main.c (computes factorial)
2) program slack.c - c_code/slack.c (memory accesses) 
3) program blasting UDP packets
4) photos - when the photos a

PART B
every code (1,2,3), sleeps for 25ms in a loop
Each of the loop runs with following time

a) ./main 5 1000
Time elapsed in ms: 10.000000 gtod 14030          

c) ./slack 
Time elapsed in ms: 270.000000gtod 274159

b) 
sometimes loop period are different (not sure if there are other interrupts
processor is serving in between) 
./udp_blast 127.0.0.1 9999 /sbin/flex
total diff : 0.11844

total diff : 0.21807 

PART C
There are different windows used for the spectrograms,
in each plots-
a) blackman
b) kaiser (with parameter FFT_SIZE,{4,8,40}
c) hamming

Seems like blackman look decent. Higher kaiser parameter values aren't helpful
as expected (atleast to me). 

PART D
There are different FFT_SIZE values taken but 2048 seems reasonable.
Large values of 32768 destroy the temporal distribution of the spectrograms
plotted for first few milliseconds.

ACTIVITY FOLDERS:
There are different folders for each activity.
Photos has the details for it.
