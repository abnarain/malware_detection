PART A
The spectrograms are of following activities:

1) program main.c - c_code/main.c 
2) program slack.c - c_code/slack.c (memory accesses) 
3) program blasting UDP packets
4) photos - when the photos a


PART B
There are different windows used for the spectrograms,
in each plots-
a) blackman
b) kaiser (with parameter FFT_SIZE,{4,8,40}
c) hamming

Seems like blackman look decent. Higher kaiser parameter values aren't helpful
as expected (atleast to me). 

PART C
There are different FFT_SIZE values taken but 2048 seems reasonable.
Large values of 32768 destroy the temporal distribution of the spectrograms
plotted for first few milliseconds.

ACTIVITY FOLDERS:
There are different folders for each activity.
Photos has the details for it.
