PART A
The spectrograms are of following activities:

1) program main.c - c_code/main.c 
2) program slack.c - c_code/slack.c (memory accesses) 
3) program blasting UDP packets
4) photos - when the photos a

-There is a sleep for 25 ms in 1), 2) and 3)
-The photoframe displays photographs by default while above three processes are
running. These processes mask the photos display in photo spectrogram 

-Photos is just the normal display of photos on the photoframe.
-The screen goes blank every ~20 seconds.
-There are multiple photos displayed ~7-8 seconds but they are not exact seconds
it seems. There is variability.



PART B
There are different windows used for the spectrograms,
in each plots-
a) blackman
b) kaiser (with parameter FFT_SIZE,{4,8,40}
c) hamming

Seems like blackman look decent. Higher kaiser parameter values aren't helpful
as expected (atleast to me). 

PART C
There are different FFT_SIZE values taken but 2048 seems reasonable.
Large values of 32768 destroy the temporal distribution of the spectrograms
plotted for first few milliseconds.
