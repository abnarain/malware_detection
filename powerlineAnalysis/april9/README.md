Samples are collected from powerline using SDR. 
Sample rate = 1 MHz; Center frequency =500 KHz

Raspberry Pi is in three states: idle, not running and running a factorial code.
Spectograms are plotted for each case to look for distinction. Data is run
through a low pass filter.
Spectrograms with NFFT =1024  is better than NFFT=256. 
The overlap =NFFT/2- Doesn't give a good time domain resolution, as it is too high.
