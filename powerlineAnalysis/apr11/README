all_ files are related to all the devices plugged in and out.
devices - Desktop, Laptop, Raspi Pi, Photoframe.

There are two devices for which the spectrograms are constructed.
a) Raspi- Raspberrry Pi
b) pf - Photoframe

The plots can be one of three states:
a) idle - when the processor is running usual jobs
b) loop - when it is running a loop (calculating factorial and sleep for 250 ms)
c) nill - when the device is turned off

The filename represents the information regarding the file:
apr11_idle_pf_0_500KHz_cspecg_32768

This shows the pdf is 
idle - when processor is idle
pf   - it is from photoframe and the
500KHz - sampling frequency was 500KHz
cspecg - spectrogram using quadrature samples
32768  - number of FFT points used in spectrogram (2^15)
