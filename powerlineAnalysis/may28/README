all_EMI.pdf : shows the three activities on a spectrogram.
They do not seem distinguishable.

Plots--
loop_mult.pdf : shows the time, spectral and cepstral domain representation
of the signal received when a loop computing a multiplication is run on a Lenova laptop.

udp.pdf : shows the three domains when UDP packets are injected into loopback interface.

idle.pdf : shows the three domains when the laptop is not given any of above jobs and is running idle.

Inference--
The differences are not very distint, but if one looks carefully- there are subtle differences.
