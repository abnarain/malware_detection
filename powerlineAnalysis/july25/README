Analysis of data collected on june_28 using lenovo laptop.

All experiments are done using TrippLite Isolation transformer to remove unnecessary noise from power-line
There are two folders where 
1) ram - the OS is loaded in RAM using USBstick since the Hard disk is detached
2) hd - when the hard disk is attached and OS loads as expected

Brief note on Wavelet Analysis:
There is fundamental tradeoff between time and frequency resolution with Fourier transform.
The one big leap in signal processing/analysis in past century is Wavelet transform.
Fourier to Wavelet Transform(Multi resolution Analysis) is as huge a leap as from Taylor series to Fourier series.

Instead of using infinite exponential functions, one uses time-limited exponential functions as the basis vectors
for analysis. 
We are using discrete wavelet transforms which passes the signal through high pass and low pass filters in a tree
fashion as below:
Ai are the coefficients of the Approximation Filter (Low pass filter) and Di is Detailed Filter (High Pass Filter)
At every stage, one is downsampling by a factor of 2
Signal
  |
D1 A1
    |
  D2 A2
     |
    D3 A3

There is much more to explain, but this should be reasonable for looking at the plot.

Plot structure:
The plot first shows multiple subplots
1) Signal (0.06 seconds) at 10 MHz sampling rate
2) A5 - Low pass filter at level (stage 5)
3) D5 - High pass filter at level (stage 5)
4) Spectrogram

1:
a)none - When nothing is connected to the Isolation transformer
b)adapterOpen- When the adapter is connected to the Isolation transfomer, but not to the laptop
c)apapter - When the adapter is connected to the laptop and Isolation transformer but the laptop is Off

c)https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_adapter_all.pdf

Conclusion: There doesn't seem to be 

2: Different activity
a) Idle (No activity initiated by me. Mostly whatever random events happen due to OS scheduling)
b) Blasting UDP packets
c) Computation

b) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_udpblast_all.pdf
c) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_compute_all.pdf
Conclusion: There is change in energy in idle and activity.


3: UDP tx in presence and absence of ethernet interface up
a) Idle
b) When UDP packets are transmitted

b) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_udpblast_ethdown_all.pdf
Conclusion : obvious difference

4) Display effect 
a) Idle
b) Display is turned Off
c) Display is turned Off and ethernet and wlan interface also

b) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_dispOff_all.pdf
c) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_dispOff_ethwlandown_all.pdf

Conclusion : Difference is observable

5) Computation when Hard disk is attached and when not attached
a) Computation when hard disk attached
b) Computation when hard disk unattached

a) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/hd_10MHz/hd_compute_all.pdf
b) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_compute_all.pdf

Conclusion: 
Computation is high power consuming activity so the finger print is very similar when computing in a loop

6)Hard disk attached and doing file copy using dd  
a) Idle
b) file copy using dd (chunksize=4096 bytes)

a) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/hd_10MHz/hd_idle_all.pdf
b) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/hd_10MHz/hd_dd_all.pdf

Conclusion: There is a difference 

7) Display off but remarkably different signatures when Hard disk is attached and not attached.
a) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/hd_10MHz/hd_dispOff_all.pdf
b) https://github.com/abnarain/malware_detection/blob/master/powerlineAnalysis/july25/ram_10MHz/ram_dispOff_all.pdf

Conclusion: Compared to (5), there is vast difference in the signature of display in this case.
