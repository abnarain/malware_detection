The folder contains data from measurements done on Powerline traces when 
a) code was running on the photoframe(iot device) 
b) when it was idle and 
c) when it was switched off

LFT card was tuned at center frequency at 0Hz, and Sample Rate = 2 MHz
(oversampling).

Shwetak's papers are basically showing activity in 0-125KHz range, hence
I have clipped the spectrograms within the range, apart from 0-1MHz range.

The FFT binsize(NFFT= 131072 = 2^17), hence the spectral resolution is
(2MHz/131072) is 15.25Hz/bin.
