1) use the dns config files to run the DNS server given in the folder.
2) use network/interfaces file in the folder and modify to create static ip addresses for the other two VMs (Mirai CNC server and client).

Use two adapters if you want. NAT and Bridged.
Atleast use Bridged Adapter setting for eth0 interface for virtual network to work for the devices.


Extras:
a) to remove keys while logging to different VMs
ssh-keygen -f "/home/zer0cha0s/.ssh/known_hosts" -R [127.0.0.1]:2222


b) Run the following commands to create the correct routes when the Virtuabox doesn't work right even with NATting turned on the Settings panel
1. sudo ip route add 10.0.2.0/24 dev enp0s3
2. sudo route add default gw 10.0.2.2 enp0s3
3. sudo ifconfig enp0s3 10.0.2.15
